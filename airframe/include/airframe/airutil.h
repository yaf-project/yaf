/**
 * @mainpage Airframe Application Utility Library
 *
 * @section Introduction
 *
 * Airframe is an application utility library designed to ease the creation of
 * command-line applications written in C that process data from a variety of
 * input sources to a variety of output sources. It builds atop the fundamental
 * data structures and utilities in glib (http://www.gtk.org) 2.0, adding
 * additional higher-level functionality.
 *
 * All of the Airframe modules provide their own command-line processing atop
 * the GOption facility; in this way, all Airframe applications have similar
 * command-line user interfaces.
 *
 * Airframe was originally developed for NAF
 * (http://tools.netsa.cert.org/naf), and is the mechanism by which the NAF
 * tools have a common interface. It evolved from the libair common library
 * used by the AirCERT project (http://aircert.sourceforge.net). It is released
 * as a separate library in the hopes that other applications developers may
 * find it useful.
 *
 * @section Modules
 *
 * Airframe provides four modules which may be used to ease application
 * creation. The daeconfig module (defined in daeconfig.h) handles
 * user-controlled daemonization, compatible with the filedaemon pattern.
 * The privconfig module (defined in privconfig.h) handles
 * user-controlled privilege management. The logconfig module (defined in
 * logconfig.h) handles user-controlled log message routing. The mio module
 * (defined in mio.h and mio_config.h) handles user-controlled file, network,
 * and packet capture I/O and record-oriented dispatch.
 *
 * @section Utilities
 *
 * Additional utility functions we've found useful in building applications
 * for handling network event data are defined in airutil.h. airopt.h defines
 * a command-line options processing layer atop glib-2 or popt, and is used
 * by Airframe's modules and client applications. Also, airlock.h allows
 * applications not using MIO for I/O and dispatch to interoperate with
 * filedaemon-style locking.
 *
 * The filedaemon pattern implemented by MIO may be wrapped around any
 * stdin-to-stdout filter application using the
 * <a href="../filedaemon.1.pdf">filedaemon</a> application built and installed
 * with Airframe.
 *
 * Airframe also includes an application called
 * <a href="../airdaemon.1.pdf">airdaemon</a> which simply invokes
 * a child process and restarts it after a configurable delay if it exits
 * abnormally.  airdaemon can retry after a fixed delay, or use a binary
 * exponential backoff strategy to increase the retry delay.
 *
 * @section Copyright
 *
 * Airframe is copyright 2006-2024 Carnegie Mellon University, and is released
 * under the GNU Lesser General Public License. See the COPYING file in the
 * distribution for details.
 *
 * Airframe was developed at the CERT Network Situational Awareness Group
 * by Brian Trammell for use in the NAF tools; certain modules
 * were written by Tony Cebzanov
