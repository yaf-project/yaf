Version 3.0.0.alpha1: 2022-02-28
================================

Merged the configuration files yafApplabelRules.conf and yafDPIRules.conf into a single file written in Lua. Previous versions of those files will not work with this version of yaf.

Changed Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) support to be compiled into yaf when requested by configure; it is no longer a plug-in. Run configure with --enable-dpi to enable the capability; run yaf with --dpi to use it. Specifying --dpi enables application labeling; it is no longer necessary to explicitly specify --applabel when enabling DPI.

Changed yaf to export metadata about information elements and templates by default: both as compile-time and run-time options. To disable on an invocation, run yaf with the --no-element-metadata and/or --no-template-metadata switches. To disable support entirely, pass --disable-metadata-export to configure. (Note that super_mediator-2.0.0 works best with template metadata enabled.)

Updated yaf to use the enhanced template metadata available in libfixbuf-3.0.0.  This allows yaf to declare that it only uses some templates within sub-records (that is, within a subTemplateList or subTemplateMultiList).  The metadata also describes the information element yaf uses in its basicLists.

Updated, rearranged, and fixed bugs in SMTP DPI.

Note: The yaf in this release crashes if built with GLib 2.75.3 or newer.

Version 2.12.1: 2020-12-22
==========================
